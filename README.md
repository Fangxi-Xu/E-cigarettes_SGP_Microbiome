# Electronic Cigarette Use Promotes a Unique Periodontium Microbiome
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) have become prevalent as an alternative to conventional cigarette smoking and in youth. E-cigs aerosol contain unique chemicals which can alter the oral microbiome and promot dysbiosis. We expand on a study involving 84 subjects who were either conventional smokers, e-cig smokers, or nonsmokers. Clinical measures of periodontal health, proinflammatory cytokine levels, and periodontal microbial biomass were obtained from patients at baseline and follow-up visits. Clinical measures reflected the smoking habits of cohorts, with conventional smokers demonstrating more severe periodontitis and several e-cig users progressing from mild to moderate periodontitis between visits. Periodontal microbial community analysis revealed that alpha diversity increased similarly across all cohorts over time and that each cohort hosted a unique microbiome. Pathogen-containing genera positively correlated with clinical measures and inflammatory cytokines. The e-cig microbiome shared many characteristics with conventional smokers and some with nonsmokers, yet maintained a unique taxa composition. Our data suggest that e-cig use promotes a unique periodontal microbiome, appearing as an intermediate state between smoking and nonsmoking.
